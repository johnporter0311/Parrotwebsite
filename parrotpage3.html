              tend to live past 50 years old.
              Bird rescues see a lot of
              parrots that come in from households where their owners have passed away.

            <p><strong>High maintenance</strong>. Parrots are extremely high maintenance. Parrots require a lot of time
              and the more you have the more time that is required.
              On average you would need to spend a few hours a day with each bird but it also depends on the bird.
              Each bird is as different as people. Having a parrot is like having a 3 year old that never grows up.

            <p><strong>The pain</strong> of owning a parrot. Like any pet, parrots <a href="#l" id="bitePicture"
                data-toggle="popover" title="A bird bite to the face" data-img="images/birdbite.jpg">bite</a>. 
              Parrots bite for numerous reasons. In most cases it is because you did something they do
              not like.
              Sometimes they want to play, they are hungry, they may not like you, they might bite because they are
              scared, or
              they may be just looking to get a reaction from you. Regardless of the reason, a bite from a parrot hurts a
              lot. The larger species of parrot have the ability to remove a finger with a bite.
              They do not care where they bite. It can be a finger, hand, arm, foot, leg, or face. So if you like scares,
              then by all means, get a parrot because if you have a parrot long enough you will get bit.

            <p><strong>Aggression</strong> of some parrots can be bad. Especially if you are not expecting it. They may
              have had a bad experience with a human. For example a person with a beard may have abused the parrot.
              That parrot will show fear and <a href="#l" id="95angerPicture" data-toggle="popover" title="Truth"
                data-img="images/95anger.jpg">aggression</a> to every person with a beard. Some parrots may show
              aggression toward men or women in general.
              Most parrots will be sweet but show aggression when in their cage. They live there and will aggressively
              defend that home. Basically, always assume the parrot is aggressive until the parrot proves otherwise.

            <p><strong>Mating season</strong> can certainly add to the aggression. Parrots become aggressive and
              unpredictable. Depending on the breed of parrot breeding season can last months.
              For example, Cockatoos have two seasons. During this time they are completely unpredictable and could bite for no
              reason.
              Even if the parrot does not have a mate or other parrots around. The hormones are there. A wrong touch or
              if the parrot is pet incorrectly can trigger aggression when their hormones are peaking.</p>

            <p><strong>Noise</strong> is a parrots middle name. Parrots are extremely loud by nature. Parrots have
              morning chatter, daily chatter, happy outbursts, alarm calls,
              mating calls, evening greetings, and bedtime calls. A 747 Jumbo Jet produces as much as 140 decibels of
              noise.
              105db is considered damaging to the ear. Peacocks have been registered at 115 db. Cockatoos hold the record
              as the loudest bird on earth at 135db. So try having a conversation or taking a nap with that kind of noise.

            <p><strong>Sizes</strong> of parrots vary. Parrots can range in <a href="#l" id="sizeofparrotsPicture"
                data-toggle="popover" title="Varies sizes of parrots" data-img="images/sizeofparrots.jpg">size</a> from
              about 3.5 to 40 inches and weigh 2.25 to 56 ounces, on average.
              The world's heaviest type of parrot is the kakapo, which can weigh up to 9 lbs. The smallest parrot is the
              buff-faced pygmy parrot, which is only about 3 inches tall and weighs just 0.4 ounces.
              They size of their cage is extremely important. As a general rule, the cage should be at least one and a
              half times larger than the parrots wing span.
              That can lead to tight quarters in a lot of homes for people especially if they have more than one bird.
              Not having the proper sized cage can cause destructive behavior such as aggression or plucking.</p>

            <p><strong>Respiratory systems</strong> of parrots are very sensitive. Their respiratory system is highly sensitive to
              smells. Items such household cleaners,
              candles, perfumes, and air fresheners can make a parrot very sick quickly or kill them with no warning.
              Imagine paying $3000 for a parrot,
              another $1000 for the cage, and hundreds for food and toys only to light a candle or use a spray cleaner
              in your kitchen and have your parrot fall over dead moments after using the item.

              But if the bird is suffering from depression or anxiety, then it is amplified.
              Parrots like to naturally chew which leads to that destructive power. You can buy a $100 toy and it
              will be reduced to splinters in seconds.
              Accidentally let them near window blinds, telephone cords, window sills, walls, flooring, etc.. and you

            <p><strong>Messy</strong> and parrots go hand in hand. Destroying your favorite shoes or destroying your
              walls can leave a mess.
              But other aspects of leaving a mess must be considered. Parrots poop a lot. They can build up towers of
              poop quickly.
              Although most can be potty trained, if they have to go then they do not care where. 
              Unfortunately they like to throw their food. It is amazing how far they can throw it when they want to.
              Some parrots, such as Cockatoos, have a <a href="#l" id="cockatoodustPicture" data-toggle="popover"
                title="Dust of a Cockatoo" data-img="images/cockatoodust.jpg">dust</a>. This dust helps make their
              feathers water proof. If they are not bathed often
              that dust builds. It comes off on you and your clothing when you handle them. It can also affect the
              respiratory system
              of other parrots. This dust can get into your home heating and cooling system and affect your respiratory
              system.

            <p><strong>Routine</strong> is key to a parrot's life. Parrots like routine. Awakening at a certain time,
              feeding at a certain time, playing and interacting at certain times,
              and going to bed at a certain time. As we know life can screw with routines. As people we generally adapt
              and overcome. Parrots do not care. They do not adapt to new things well or quickly. This causes depression, and anxiety
              which leads to destructive attitudes towards themselves or others. So if your routine changes a lot. Then
              a Parrot is not for you.

              these media devices parrots say anything you want and on cue. This is nowhere near the truth. Yes parrots can mimic sounds they
              hear over and over but it is seldom on cue. In fact, some parrot species do not speak in a language we understand. This belief
              that parrots speak regularly is often why parrots are abused when they do not speak on cue or are turned over to a rescue
              because they are no longer wanted as a novel status symbol.
