        <p>My name is Cherokee. I am a very spoiled 23 year old Catalina macaw.
          I like going for rides with my dad and giving kisses.
          I like to talk but only when Dad is around.
          Otherwise I will whisper.
          Some of my favorite words or phrases are "Pretty bird, hello, and Goodbye".
          I have a bell that I like to ring when I want some attention.
          I am not fond of other people but I tolerate them.
          My previous owner did not spend much time with me so I started plucking my feathers out.
          This caused anxiety which is a mental illness that I may never get over.
          The right care and attention will help me reduce my anxiety.</p>

        <p>My name is Ozzy. I am a 18 year old Blue and Gold macaw.
          I am a show off and like to be the center of attention.
          I am very much a mama's boy. I require a hug and kiss from mom before she leaves for work every day.
          I control the household.
          I tell the other birds in my flock to "Be Quiet!, "Shut up!" and tell everyone when it is dinner time or when
          it is time to go to bed.
          I do not tolerate others touching me unless it is dad, who I demand he play fight with me.
          I have had several homes in my 18 years but I have definitely found my forever home.</p>

        <p>My name is Zuzu. I am a 11 year old Blue and Gold macaw.
          I am also a mama's girl. I do not tolerate other people at all,
          unless they are giving me what I want which is usually food or a ride to mom.
          I am super fast and will definitely bite you hard if I get a chance.
          You may have noticed that my beak looks different. I have a condition called scissor beak.
          It is caused by people feeding me incorrectly when I was just a chick.
          I will be like this for the rest of my life.
          When I was rescued from my previous owners I had to be taken to the vet because my beak had grown so much it
          had punctured my cheek.
          It was really hard for me to eat. When I was rescued, my previous owners refused to give me up despite being
          unable to eat that they made the rescue pay $1000 to free me and allow me to get medical attention.
          Unfortunately I have to make regular trips to the vet to make sure my beak stays ground down.</p>

        <p>My name is Merlin. I am a 31 year old Cockatoo.
          I was the first in the this flock. I love to snuggle and be loved on.
          I do not like people with beards, masks, or hats.
          Even though I love to snuggle I will bite hard if I get too excited.
          I am a very picky eater which makes it hard to find the right food for me.
          I love to chew on things which makes me very destructive if I am not carefully watched.
          I do not mind other birds as long as they leave me alone. I am the household alarm clock.
          When I see the sun come up, I start screaming to make sure everyone is wide awake.</p>

        <p>My name is Cassie. I am the sweetest, most gentle 33 year old Cockatoo girl you will ever find, just ask me.
          However, if you mess with my man Merlin, I will let you know with a few well placed bites.
          I love food and will be more than happy to taste it for you. It does not matter where you are.
          If I am not in my cage, I will come to you for the food. I am not afraid of anything.
          I do not like cats and I will chase them and bite them if I can catch them.
          I will even show the German Shepherds in our flock who runs things.
          I have been homed at least four times.
          Most of the time because my previous owners did not understand me or neglected me.</p>
