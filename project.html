         <p>My name is Cherokee.  I am a very spoiled 23 year old Catalina macaw. 
           I like going for rides with my dad and giving kisses. 
           I like to talk but only when Dad is around.
           Otherwise I will whisper.
           Some of my favorite words or phrases are "Pretty bird, hello, and Goodbye".
           I have a bell that I like to ring when I want some attention.
           I am not fond of other people but I tolerate them. 
           My previous owner did not spend much time with me so I started plucking my feathers out.  
           This caused anxiety which is a mental illness that I may never get over.

            I am very much a mama's boy.  I require a hug and kiss from mom before she leaves for work every day.  
            I control the household.  
            I tell the other birds in my flock to "Be Quiet!, "Shut up!" and tell everyone when it is dinner time or when it is time to go to bed. 
            I do not tolerate others touching me unless it is dad, who I demand he play fight with me.  
            I have had several homes in my 18 years but I have definitely found my forever home.</p>

           I am super fast and will definitely bite you hard if I get a chance.  
           You may have noticed that my beak looks different. I have a condition called scissor beak.  
           It is caused by people feeding me incorrectly when I was just a chick. 
           I will be like this for the rest of my life.  
           When I was rescued from my previous owners I had to be taken to the vet because my beak had grown so much it had punctured my cheek.  
           It was really hard for me to eat.  When I was rescued, my previous owners refused to give me up despite being unable to eat that they made the rescue pay $1000 to free me and allow me to get medical attention.  
           Unfortunately I have to make regular trips to the vet to make sure my beak stays ground down.</p>

             I love to chew on things which makes me very destructive if I am not carefully watched.

           I love food and will be more than happy to taste it for you.  It does not matter where you are.  
           If I am not in my cage, I will come to you for the food. I am not afraid of anything. 
           I do not like cats and I will chase them and bite them if I can catch them.  
           I will even show the German Shepherds in our flock who runs things.  
           I have been homed at least four times.  
           Most of the time because my previous owners did not understand me or neglected me.</p>

           <h2 id="Understanding">Understanding why parrots are a bad idea</h2>
           <br>
          <p>To understand why people should not own a parrot, you first have to understand what is a parrot.
              A parrot is defined as bird, often vividly colored, with a short down-curved hooked bill, grasping feet.
              There are more than 350 bird species, including parakeets, macaws, cockatiels and cockatoos, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). 
              Parrot sizes vary widely. Parrots can range in size from about 3.5 to 40 inches 
              and weigh 2.25 to 56 ounces, on average. 
              The world's heaviest type of parrot is the kakapo, which can weigh up to 9 lbs.  
              The smallest parrot is the buff-faced pygmy parrot, which is only about 3 inches tall and weighs just 0.4 ounces.
              The needs of parrots vary as widely there are species.</p>

<p>Parrots cost a lot of money.  Acquiring a parrot from a shelter can cost up to $800.
  Acquiring a parrot from a breeder can cost as much as $3000 or more.  This does not include cages, toys, or food.</p>

        <p>Parrots are extremely high maintenance.  Parrots require a lot of time and the more you have the more time that is required
          On the average you would need to spend a few hours a day with each bird.  That also depends on the bird.
          Each bird is as different as people. However, imagine having a 3 year old that never grows up.
        That is what it is like having a parrot</p>

      <p>Like any pet, parrots bite.  The problem with parrots they bite for numerous reasons.  In most cases it is because you did something they do not like.
        Sometimes they want to play.  Or they are hungry.  They may not like you.  They might bite because they scared.
        They may be just looking to get a reaction from you.  Regardless of the reason a bite from a parrot hurts a lot.  The larger species of parrot have the ability to remove a figure with a bite.
        They do not care where they bite.  It can a finger, hand, arm, foot, leg, or face.  So if you like scares, then by all means, let a parrot bite you.

      <p>Some parrots are aggressive.  They may have had a bad experience with a human.  For example a person with a beard may have abused the parrot. 
        That parrot will show fear and aggression to every person with a beard. Some parrots may show aggression toward men or women in general.
      Most parrots will be sweet but show aggression when their cage.  They live there and will aggressively defend that home.

      <p>Part of aggression, during mating season parrots become aggressive and unpredictable.  Depending on the breed of parrot breeding season can last months.
        Cockatoos have two seasons.  During this time they are completely unpredictable and could bite for no reason.

          <p>Parrots are extremely loud by nature.  Parrots have morning chatter, daily chatter, happy outbursts, alarm calls,
            mating calls, evening greetings, and bedtime calls.  A 747 Jumbo Jet produces as much as 140 decibels of noise. 
            105db is considered damaging to the ear. Peacocks have been registered at 115, Cockatoos hold the record as the loudest bird on earth at 135db.
          So try having a conversation or taking a nap with that kind of noise. </p>

            They size of their cage is extremely important.  As a general rule, the cage should be at least one and half times larger than their wing span. 
          That ca lead to tight quarters in a lot of homes for people especially if they have more than one bird.  
        Not having the proper sized cage can cause destructive behavior such as aggression or plucking.</p>

        <p>Parrots have a very sensitive respiratory system.  Their system is highly sensitive to smells.  Items such household cleaners,
          candles, perfumes, air fresheners can make a parrot very sick quickly or kill them with no warning.  Imagine paying $3000 for a parrot,
          another $1000 for the cage, and hundreds for food and toys only to light a candle or use a spray cleaner in your kitchen
          to have your parrot fall over dead moments after using the item.

        <p>Parrots like people have mental issues. Depression can be caused by several things.  No socialized enough, the wrong food, abuse, dirty cage, ect..
           Parrots can and will pluck their own feathers. 
           Feather plucking can occur in cases where birds are severely depressed and unsettled in their environments.

        <p>Parrots are destructive.  This ability to destroy things is in their nature.  But if the bird is suffering from depression or anxiety, then it is amplified.
          Parrots like to naturally like to chew which leads to that destructive power.  You can by a $100 toy and it will be reduced to splinters in seconds.
          Accidentally let them near window blind, telephone cords, window sills, walls, flooring, ect.. and you could be looking at thousands in repairs.

        <p>Parrots are messy.  Destroying you favorite shoes or destroying your walls can leave a mess.
          But other aspects of leaving a mess must be considered.  Parrots poop a lot.  They can build up towers of poop quickly.
          Although most be be potty trained, if they have to go then they do not care where.  Parrots require a special diet.
          Unfortunately they like to throw their food.  It is amazing how far they can throw it when they want to.
          Some parrots, such as Cockatoos, have a dust.  This dust helps make their feathers water proof.  If they are not bathed often 
          that dust builds.  It comes off on you and your clothing when you handle them.  It can also affect the respiratory system 
          of other parrots.  This dust can get into your home heating and cooling system and affect your respiratory system.

        <p>Parrots like routine.  Awaking at a certain time, feeding at a certain time, playing and interacting at certain times
          and going to bed at a certain time.  As we know life can screw with routines.  As people we generally adapt and overcome.
          Parrots do not care.  They do not adapt to new things well or quickly.  This causes depression, and anxiety
          which leads to destructive attitudes towards themselves or others.  So if your routine changes a lot.  Then a Parrot is not for you.

        <p>Movies, and television shows have done the parrot world a great disservice.  According to these media devices
          parrots say anything you want and on cue.  This is nowhere near the true.  Yes parrots can mimic sounds they hear over and over
          but it is seldom on cue.  In fact, some parrot species not speak in a language we understand.  This belief that parrots
          speak regularly is often parrots are abused when they do not speak on cue or are turned over to a rescue because they are no longer 
          wanted as a novel status symbol.
