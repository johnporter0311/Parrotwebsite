Project Description:
My parrot website project is based on personal experiences.  Too may sites tell you how great parrots are as pets.  
They are great pets but there is limited information out there that tells you the "dark side" of parrot ownership.  
If I was able to find a site that fully explained the cons of owning a parrot then I probably never would have bought
my first parrot.  I hope this site gives the information I never had.
Designing this site gave me a lot of issues.  I started using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I had nothing but trouble.  
Then I discovered Bootstrap and it fell into place for me.  Using Bootstrap I had to relearn some things but Bootstrap
allow for me to use a lot of built in CSS which reduced my need for extra coding.  Treehouse always taught to keep it simple.
That is what Bootstrap did for me.
My website also includes in areas on the third page with colored words.  Clicking on these words will bring up pictures
that pertain to that paragraph.  This also includes a sound bite. **

Feature Requirements:
Choose a minimum of 3 of the below features and incorporate into your site
**A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)**
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes
Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout 
**Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format**
**Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button).**
Use JavaScript to perform math operations and display the result on your site
Create and populate a JavaScript array, then retrieve and display one or more values from it
Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list)
**Import Bootstrap from a CDN and use its column system to create a responsive design**
**Imported the CDN but it was not always up so it was hosted locally to ensure that it is available when project is checked.**
**Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through.  The carousel has a hover feature on it.  
The carousel will stop when the cursor hovers over the picture.**
Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific and as long as it’s a good demonstration of your programming skills, it almost certainly will count! Basically, we just want to see you do something interesting and challenging!


Additional Requirements
ALL of the below requirements must be met.
Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way
**Page header reduced to properly show on a mobile screen.
**There are two differently sized page headers on every page.  One is shown only on large and x-large screens. The other only on smaller screens.
**On page 3, the "Reasons not to get a parrot" is sized differently.  One is smaller for medium and smaller screens while a larger one is shown for large and x-large screens.
We will look at your app on a desktop screen and a mobile device to see what changes occur
We must be able to see the change that your code is making on your website - a media query can be written correctly but have no actual effect. That will not be ok in this class.

Your project includes at minimum 3 custom-written CSS elements (selectors, classes, etc) located in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
The CSS must be included in its own file, not “in-line” on your HTML page - we want to see that you can properly “link” a stylesheet
Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement
** Style.css is my external css file.
** Multi-colored header is custom in the external css file.
** Page 3 special font imported for use on page title in css file.
** Extra padding was needed for the "Bios".  I added the extra padding to give it the spacing it needed.

Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file
Script tags in your HTML file must execute the JS file
Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfill this requirement
** Java.js is my external js file.
** Form from page 3 is validated in the external js file.
** From page 3 multiple popovers are located in the external js file.

Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine
**Done

Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, with at least 5 commits
We need to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile at least 5 times
** More than 5 commits. https://github.com/johnporter0311/Project

Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git. 

It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
**This file
A description of your project
What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)
Any special instructions we might need to run your project
