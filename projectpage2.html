       <br>
      <p>To understand why people should not own a parrot, you first have to understand what is a parrot.
          A parrot is defined as bird, often vividly colored, with a short down-curved hooked bill, grasping feet.
          There are more than 350 bird species, including parakeets, macaws, cockatiels and cockatoos, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). 
          Parrot sizes vary widely. Parrots can range in size from about 3.5 to 40 inches 
          and weigh 2.25 to 56 ounces, on average. 
          The world's heaviest type of parrot is the kakapo, which can weigh up to 9 lbs.  
          The smallest parrot is the buff-faced pygmy parrot, which is only about 3 inches tall and weighs just 0.4 ounces.
          The needs of parrots vary as widely there are species.</p>
